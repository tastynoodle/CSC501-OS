Original:
Advantage: the process with highest priority run first. When you have some urgent task (highest prority), this policy can finish it within the shortest time.
Disadvantage: casue starvations.

Linux:
Advantage: prevent starvations.
Disadvantage: When you put some urgent tasks, it may still take a lot time to finish.

Disadvantage: In the real-time queue, starvation problem still exists.
